    <h1>Fresh Tomato Pasta</h1>
    <img src="../img/pasta_tomato.png" alt="Image of Tomato Pasta">
    <p>This is an extremely simple pasta recipe that I love to make when I don't really feel like cooking! I use
        rigatoni, but you can use whatever pasta you prefer. This is especially delicious with tomatoes fresh from your
        garden. Serve with garlic bread and a simple lettuce salad with Italian dressing.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package dry pasta</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic</li>
        <li>1 medium tomato</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>

    <ol>
        <p>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat.</li>
        </p>

        <p>
            <li>Coarsely chop the tomato and transfer to a small bowl. Sprinkle the tomato chunks with basil, olive oil,
                and salt. Set aside.</li>
        </p>

        <p>
            <li>Once the water is boiling, stir in the rigatoni, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered,
                stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 12
                minutes. Drain well in a colander, and then return the pasta to the pot.</li>
        </p>

        <p>
            <li>Pour the tomato mixture over the pasta and toss to mix.</li>
        </p>
    </ol>
